# KummerIsogenies

This repository contains the code which is attached to *Efficient (3,3)-isogenies on fast Kummer surfaces* by [Maria Corte-Real Santos](https://www.mariascrs.com/), [Craig Costello](https://www.craigcostello.com.au/) and [Benjamin Smith](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~smith/). All of the code in this repository was written in [`Magma`](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/), [`SageMath`](https://www.sagemath.org/) and `Python`.

The directories are arranged as follows:
- In the directory `Magma` contains files which implement the $(3,3)$-isogenies given in the paper, the hash function **KuHash** built from chains of these isogenies, and files verifying claims made in Section 4 of the paper. All files written in this folder are written in `Magma`.

- The directory `Sagemath` contains files which implement the $(3,3)$-isogenies given in the paper and the hash function **KuHash** built from chains of these isogenies. All files written in this folder are written in `SageMath/Python`.
